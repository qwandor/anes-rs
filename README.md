# ANSI Escape Sequence

A Rust library which provides an ANSI escape sequences (or codes, whatever you like more).

Current status is **experimental**.

## Motivation

There're couple of terminal crates like:

* [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm),
* [termion](https://github.com/redox-os/termion),
* etc.

All these crates do share two pieces of code:

* ANSI escape sequences and
* input event parsers.

I think that it's a waste of resources and asked Timon (the `crossterm` crate maintainer) what he thinks
about a new crate as a building block for the `crossterm` and other crates. And here we
are ...

## Goals

* Provide ANSI escape sequences.
* Provide input events parser (2nd phase).

This crate does not and wont support execution or any other features not mentioned in
the goals section. It should be used as a building block for other crates like `crossterm` and
not as a replacement. Think about this when requesting new features.
